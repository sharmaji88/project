           Logic building with industrial project - 1
***************************************************

Name :
 Customised Virtual File System

Technology used :
C Programming Language

Desrciption : 
This Project is used create customised file System
 which can be work on windows NT platforms.
we are going to implement UFS file System.

Software Requirement :
Any operating System.

Hardware Requirement :
Minimum 512 MB of RAM necessory.

Platform :
We prefer windows NT oprating System.

Storage device:
Primary 		 RAM
Secondary 	 HDD

Everything which is storage in HDD is considered as a file.
File is unformated uniform stream of bytes.

File System :
File system is way of storing and retriving the files into
the harddisk.
Examples :
NTFS : New Technology File System(Windows)
FAT 32 / FAT 16 : File Allocation Table (16 / 32)(Linux)
UFS : UNIX File System.   (our Project used)

*****************************************************************
                     Customised Virtual File System

Customised : Becaus it is designed dependes on the user requirement
Virtual : Beacuse its used in the RAM.
File System : Way of storing and retriving the files. 

File System Programming:
	Library function - Inmtrenally calls system calls ex:fopen()
	system calls-Internally executed by the kernel ex:open()
Important System of file subsystem:
open(): it is used to open existing file
close() : it is used to close the existing file
read() : it is used to read the data from  file
write() : it is used to write data into file
lseek() : it is used to change the offset of the file
creat() : it is used to create new regular file file

int open(char * name , int mode);
	1:NAme of the file
	2:Mode in which we want to open the file (O_RDONLY , OWRONLY , O_RDWR)
	Return : Integer which is  treated as a file descripter.

void close(int fd):
1 : file decripter which is return by the open 
Return : Nothing
